* Module - this is a container for the different parts of the app you are creating.
* Controller - it is a JS constructor function that is used to augment AngularJS scope. sets up the initial state of scope object
* Data Binding - the automatic syncronization of data between the model and view components. lets you treat the model as the single source of truth in your app
* Directive - markers on a DOM element (attribute, element name, etc) that tells the compiler to attach a specific behavior to that DOM element
* Angular Expression (i.e., `{{ }}`) - snippets that are placed in interpolation bindings, but also used directly in directive attributes
